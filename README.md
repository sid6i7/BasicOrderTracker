# BasicOrderTracker

## About
A basic order tracker android application that I built for a college project.

## Features
The delivery units can:
- View the list of deliveries (dummy)
- Can either confirm or cancel the deliveries
- Enter the mode of payment + delivery status
- Can send OTP verification message of the delivery/order to the relevant shop owner (person that has placed the order).
- Can send successful delivery message to the distribution owner.
